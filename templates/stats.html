		<p class="flow">This dataset represents the coffee drinking patterns of programmers while working. The graph 1.1 shows us that programmers worked for 8 hours most frequently (19 times) and for 10 hours (17 times). Also, programmers usually have 0.25-0.75 (0.5 - average) cups of coffee per hour (graph 1.2). The heatmap 1.3 represents the relation between consumed cups and coding hours, the most frequent pattern is drinking 2 cups of coffee while working for 8 hours (11 times). We can see that the more hours programmers work, the less cups per hour they consume (plot 1.4). Both of these facts may lead us to the conclusion that coders tend to consume most of the coffee during the first hours of work, this may happen due to the facts that having an extreme amount of coffee is unhealthy and caffeine fully removes the exhaustion after some period of time, so that the programmer has 1-3 cups of coffee before it activates.</p>
		<p class="flow"> The graph 1.5 shows that programmers mostly drink coffee while coding. We will cover this variable later. The scatter plot 2.1 shows the distribution of coffee cups per each type of coffee. American coffee is consumed from 1 to 8 times while working, which indicates that it's the most popular choice. Graph 2.2 indicates that indeed, 24% of cups (max) are americano. Turkish (23%) and Nescafe (21%) are the next popular choices. The chart 2.3 tells us that the most of 196 hours (30%) of coding are spent while/after drinking Nescafe and only 25% while drinking american coffee. This interesting result may show that coders tend to have smaller, but more frequent sessions while drinking a limited number of Nescafe cups and longer sessions with many cups of americano. The heatmap 2.4 shows that programmers of age 18-29 prefer Nescafe and American coffee (in decreasing order), while older coders tend to have Nescafe and Turkish coffee.</p>
